# CAGEMATCH! 

I had such a blast putting on this show. My pal Cory Guebels spent January coaching up two brand new improv teams. Then we pitted them against each other in a Battle Royale where the audience voted for their favorite.   
Let the record show our first ever Cagematch champion is Tangletown. They get to defend their title next month.
