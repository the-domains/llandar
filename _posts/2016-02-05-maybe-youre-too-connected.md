# Maybe you're too connected?

I'm as addicted to my phone as the next guy. I don't like that fact about myself, but I also recognize it and try not to get too preachy about shit like "disconnecting" or whatever. We have miraculous tiny computers in our pocket. That's pretty incredible. We might as well use them. Sometimes, though, I'm confronted with the grim reality that not everyone is equipped to deal with this horrific power.

My morning ritual at work is usually walking upstairs to the (superior) coffee machine. As I pushed open the door from the stairwell to enter the 5th floor, I nearly smacked into a guy on his phone. Standing there. In the doorway. Staring at his phone directly in front of a closed door.

"Excuse me," I apologized, sort of expecting one of those mutually awkward exchanges, but he didn't even look up. _Hmm _was all he could muster. 

Okay fine, he's probably checking an important email or something. Whatever. I got my coffee, checked the break room TV (the folks in the call center almost always have it set on some kind of trashy reality TV), said hello to someone walking by, and made my way to the door to the stairs. I pushed it open.

And it smacked into the back of the same dude. Still on his phone.

He'd managed to get through the door, at least. But then had immediately decided to stop right there and continue staring at his phone. Why this guy thinks doorways are the best possible places to stop, I have no idea. I didn't apologize the second time around. I headed downstairs.

As far as I know, he's still there. Staring at his phone.
